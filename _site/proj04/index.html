Final Due Date: Tuesday, December 10th at 11:59PM <span style="color:red">(no extension allowed!)</span></h2><hr /><p>Welcome to Final Project, the final assignment of the quarter! 👋</p><p>This project aims to be a culmination of everything you’ve learned this quarter. In the project, you will conduct an open-ended investigation into one of the three datasets (Recipes and Ratings 🍽, League of Legends ⌨️, or Power Outages 🔋). <strong>Specifically, you’ll draw several visualizations to help understand the distributions of key variables, assess the missingness mechanisms of columns with missing values, test a hypotheses about the data, and finally, build and improve a predictive model.</strong> This project will be entirely manually graded by us – that’s right, no autograders!</p><p>Final Project worth 10% in your overall grade, which means it’s worth double what previous projects were worth. Its checkpoint is also worth double a regular checkpoint, at 2%.</p><p>As your final deliverables, you’ll submit two things to us: a <strong>public-facing website</strong> as well as a <strong>PDF of your Jupyter Notebook</strong>. We encourage you to build something you are proud of as this will give you something concrete to put on your resume and show to potential employers!</p><blockquote class="green"><p><strong>Final Project is due on Tuesday, December 10th at 11:59PM. This is a hard deadline; you may NOT use the extension on this project.</strong> This is because we need to start grading projects right when you turn them in, so that there is enough time for you to make regrade requests before we submit grades to campus. Note that we will not be able to hold many office hours during Finals Week, so make sure to start early.<br /><br /> The Final Project does also have two checkpoints, which is due on <strong>Tuesday, November 19th</strong> and <strong>Tuesday, November 26th</strong>. The Final Project Checkpoints are structured differently than other project checkpoints; rather than having you submit any code, you’ll answer a few questions about your progress on the project. More details are in the <a href="#submission-and-rubric">Checkpoint Submission</a> towards the bottom of this page. You can submit the <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/877914/assignments/5313145/">checkpoint 1</a> and <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/877914/assignments/5313131/">checkpoint 2</a> on Gradescope; make sure to tag your partner if you have one.</p></blockquote><p>The project is broken into two parts:</p><ul><li>Part 1: An <strong>analysis</strong>, submitted as a Jupyter Notebook. This will contain the details of your work. <strong>Focus on completing your analysis before moving to Part 2, as the analysis is the bulk of the project.</strong><li>Part 2: A <strong>report</strong>, submitted as a website. This will contain a narrative “story” with visuals. <strong>Focus on this after finishing <em>most</em> of your analysis.</strong></ul><hr /><h2 class="no_toc text-delta" id="table-of-contents"> <a href="#table-of-contents" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="table-of-contents"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Table of Contents</h2><ol id="markdown-toc"><li><a href="#choosing-a-dataset" id="markdown-toc-choosing-a-dataset">Choosing a Dataset</a><li><a href="#part-1-analysis" id="markdown-toc-part-1-analysis">Part 1: Analysis</a><ol><li><a href="#step-1-introduction" id="markdown-toc-step-1-introduction">Step 1: Introduction</a><li><a href="#step-2-data-cleaning-and-exploratory-data-analysis" id="markdown-toc-step-2-data-cleaning-and-exploratory-data-analysis">Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</a><li><a href="#step-3-assessment-of-missingness" id="markdown-toc-step-3-assessment-of-missingness">Step 3: Assessment of Missingness</a><li><a href="#step-4-hypothesis-testing" id="markdown-toc-step-4-hypothesis-testing">Step 4: Hypothesis Testing</a><li><a href="#step-5-framing-a-prediction-problem" id="markdown-toc-step-5-framing-a-prediction-problem">Step 5: Framing a Prediction Problem</a><li><a href="#step-6-baseline-model" id="markdown-toc-step-6-baseline-model">Step 6: Baseline Model</a><li><a href="#step-7-final-model" id="markdown-toc-step-7-final-model">Step 7: Final Model</a><li><a href="#step-8-fairness-analysis" id="markdown-toc-step-8-fairness-analysis">Step 8: Fairness Analysis</a><li><a href="#style" id="markdown-toc-style">Style</a></ol><li><a href="#part-2-report" id="markdown-toc-part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a><ol><li><a href="#step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site" id="markdown-toc-step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site">Step 1: Initializing a Jekyll GitHub Pages Site</a><li><a href="#step-2-choosing-a-theme" id="markdown-toc-step-2-choosing-a-theme">Step 2: Choosing a Theme</a><li><a href="#step-3-embedding-content" id="markdown-toc-step-3-embedding-content">Step 3: Embedding Content</a><li><a href="#local-setup" id="markdown-toc-local-setup">Local Setup</a></ol><li><a href="#submission-and-rubric" id="markdown-toc-submission-and-rubric">Submission and Rubric</a><ol><li><a href="#checkpoint-1-submission" id="markdown-toc-checkpoint-1-submission">Checkpoint 1 Submission</a><li><a href="#checkpoint-2-submission" id="markdown-toc-checkpoint-2-submission">Checkpoint 2 Submission</a><li><a href="#final-submission" id="markdown-toc-final-submission">Final Submission</a><li><a href="#rubric" id="markdown-toc-rubric">Rubric</a></ol></ol><hr /><h2 id="choosing-a-dataset"> <a href="#choosing-a-dataset" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choosing-a-dataset"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choosing a Dataset</h2><p>In this project, you will perform an open-ended investigation into a <strong>single dataset</strong>.

Use these as inspiration, but feel free to come up with your own questions and prediction problems!<li><strong>Special Considerations</strong>: Things to be aware of when working with the given dataset, e.g. some additional requirements.</ul><p>When selecting which dataset you are going to use for your project, try choosing the one whose topic appeals to you the most as that will make finishing the project a lot more enjoyable.</p><p>To help contextualize the kinds of analysis you can do in this project, it might help to look at these examples from Spring 2023. These examples offer insights into crafting effective research questions, but bear in mind that they have their unique strengths and weaknesses. Treat them as a foundation for inspiration, but <strong>don’t</strong> just repeat or copy their work – be original!</p><ol><li><a href="https://krystalqjx.github.io/LOL-analysis/">League of Legends First Blood Statistical Analysis</a>: This project excelled in clarifying their research aims, making the study understandable to a broader audience.

For instance, you may need to replace data that should be missing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code> or create new columns out of given ones (e.g. compute distances, scale data, or get time information from time stamps).<td>Describe, in detail, the data cleaning steps you took and how they affected your analyses. The steps should be explained in reference to the data generating process. Show the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> of your cleaned DataFrame (see <a href="#part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a> for instructions).<tr><td><strong>Univariate Analysis</strong><td>Look at the distributions of relevant columns separately by using DataFrame operations and drawing at least two relevant plots.<td>Embed <strong>at least one</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot you created in your notebook that displays the distribution of a single column (see <a href="#part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a> for instructions). Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one univariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)<tr><td><strong>Bivariate Analysis</strong><td>Look at the statistics of pairs of columns to identify possible associations. For instance, you may create scatter plots and plot conditional distributions, or box-plots. You must plot at least two such plots in your notebook. The results of your bivariate analyses will be helpful in identifying interesting hypothesis tests!<td>Embed <strong>at least one</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot that displays the relationship between two columns. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine.

As such, there’s no code to write here (and hence, nothing to put in your notebook).<td>State whether you believe there is a column in your dataset that is NMAR. Explain your reasoning and any additional data you might want to obtain that could explain the missingness (thereby making it MAR). Make sure to explicitly use the term “NMAR.”<tr><td><strong>Missingness Dependency</strong><td>Pick a column in the dataset with non-trivial missingness to analyze, and perform permutation tests to analyze the dependency of the missingness of this column on other columns.<br /><br />Specifically, find at least one other column that the missingness of your selected column <strong>does</strong> depend on, and at least one other column that the missingness of your selected column <strong>does not</strong> depend on.<br /><br /><strong><em>Tip</em></strong>: Make sure you know the difference between the different types of missingness before approaching that section. Many students in the past have lost credit for mistaking one type of missingness for another.<br /><br />Note that some datasets may have special requirements for this section; look at the “Special Considerations” section of your chosen dataset for more details.<td>Present and interpret the results of your missingness permutation tests with respect to your data and question. Embed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot related to your missingness exploration; ideas include:<br />• The distribution of column \(Y\) when column \(X\) is missing and the distribution of column \(Y\) when column \(X\) is not missing, as was done in <a href="https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08.html">Lecture 8</a>.<br />• The empirical distribution of the test statistic used in one of your permutation tests, along with the observed statistic.</table></div><h3 id="step-4-hypothesis-testing"> <a href="#step-4-hypothesis-testing" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-4-hypothesis-testing"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 4: Hypothesis Testing</h3><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Step<th>Analysis in Notebook<th>Report on Website<tbody><tr><td><strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong><td>Clearly state a pair of hypotheses and perform a <strong>hypothesis test or permutation test</strong> that is not related to missingness.

Feel free to use one of the example prediction problems stated in the “Example Questions and Prediction Problems” section of your dataset’s description page or pose a hypothesis test of your own. The prediction problem you come up with doesn’t have to be related to the question you were answering in Steps 1-4, but ideally, your entire project has some sort of coherent theme.<td>Clearly state your prediction problem and type (classification or regression). If you are building a classifier, make sure to state whether you are performing binary classification or multiclass classification. Report the response variable (i.e. the variable you are predicting) and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics (e.g. accuracy vs. F1-score).<br /><br /><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features. For instance, if we wanted to predict your final exam grade, we couldn’t use your Final Project grade, because the project is only due after the final exam!

Do so by engineering at least two new features from the data, on top of any categorical encodings you performed in Baseline Model Step. (For instance, you may use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StandardScaler</code> on a quantitative column and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantileTransformer</code> transformer on a different column to get two new features.) Again, implement all steps in a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sklearn</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pipeline</code>. While deciding what features to use, you <strong>must</strong> perform a search for the best hyperparameters (e.g. tree depth) to use amongst a list(s) of options, either by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GridSearchCV</code> or through some manual iterative method. In your notebook, state which hyperparameters you plan to tune and why before actually tuning them.<br /><br /><strong><em>Optional</em></strong>: You are encouraged to try many different modeling algorithms for your final model (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinearRegression</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RandomForestClassifier</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lasso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SVC</code>, etc.) If you do this, make sure to clearly indicate in your notebook which model is your actual final model as that will be used to grade the above requirements.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 1</em></strong>: When training your model, make sure you use the same unseen and seen datasets from your baseline model. This way, the evaluation metric you get on your final model can be compared to your baseline’s on the basis of the model itself and not the dataset it was trained on. Based on which method you use for hyperparameter tuning, this may mean that you will need to use some of your training data as your validation data. If this is the case, make sure to train your final model on the whole dataset prior to evaluation.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 2</em></strong>: You will not be graded on “how much” your model improved from Step 6: Baseline Model to Step 7: Final Model. What you will be graded on is on whether or not your model improved, as well as your thoughtfulness and effort in creating features, along with the other points above.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 3</em></strong>: Don’t try to improve your model’s performance just by blindly transforming existing features into new ones. Think critically about what each transformation you’re doing actually does. For example, there’s no use in using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StandardScaler</code> transformer if your goal is to reduce the RMSE of a linear model: as we learned in DSC 40A, and in Lecture 15, standardizing features in a regression model does not change the model’s predictions, only its coefficients!<td>State the features you added and <strong>why</strong> they are good for the data and prediction task. Note that you can’t simply state “these features improved my accuracy”, since you’d need to choose these features and fit a model before noticing that – instead, talk about <em>why</em> you believe these features improved your model’s performance from the perspective of the data generating process. <br /><br />Describe the modeling algorithm you chose, the hyperparameters that ended up performing the best, and the method you used to select hyperparameters and your overall model. Describe how your Final Model’s performance is an improvement over your Baseline Model’s performance.<br /><br /><strong><em>Optional</em></strong>: Include a visualization that describes your model’s performance, e.g. a confusion matrix, if applicable.</table></div><h3 id="step-8-fairness-analysis"> <a href="#step-8-fairness-analysis" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-8-fairness-analysis"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 8: Fairness Analysis</h3><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Step<th>Analysis in Notebook<th>Report on Website<tbody><tr><td><strong>Fairness Analysis</strong><td>Perform a “fairness analysis” of your Final Model from the previous step. That is, try and answer the question “does my model perform worse for individuals in Group X than it does for individuals in Group Y?”, for an interesting choice of X and Y.<br /><br />As always, when comparing some quantitative attribute (in this case, something like precision or RMSE) across two groups, we use a <strong>permutation test</strong>. Let’s illustrate how this works with an example. Let’s suppose we have a sample voter dataset with columns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Name'</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Age'</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Voted'</code>, among others. We build a classifier that predicts whether someone voted (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>) or didn’t (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>).<br /><br />Here, we’ll say our two groups are <br />• “young people”, people younger than 40<br />• “old people”, people older than 40<br /><br />Note that in this example, we manually created these groups by <strong>binarizing</strong> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Age'</code> column in our dataset, and that’s fine. (Remember, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binarizer</code> transformer with a threshold of 40 can do this for us.)<br /><br />For our evaluation metric, we’ll choose precision. (In Week 10’s lectures, we’ll look at other evaluation metrics and related parity measures for classifiers; choose the one that is most appropriate to your prediction task. If you built a regression model, you cannot use classification metrics like precision or recall; instead, you must use RMSE or \(R^2\).)<br /><br />Now, we must perform a permutation test. Before doing so, we must clearly state a null and an alternative hypothesis.<br />• <strong>Null Hypothesis</strong>: Our model is fair. Its precision for young people and old people are roughly the same, and any differences are due to random chance.<br />• <strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong>: Our model is unfair. Its precision for young people is lower than its precision for old people.<br /><br />From here, you should be able to implement the necessary permutation test. The only other guidance we will provide you with is that you should <strong>not</strong> be modifying your model to produce different results when computing test statistics; use only your final fitted model from Final Model Step.<td>Clearly state your choice of Group X and Group Y, your evaluation metric, your null and alternative hypotheses, your choice of test statistic and significance level, the resulting \(p\)-value, and your conclusion.<br /><br /><strong><em>Optional</em></strong>: Embed a visualization related to your permutation test in your website.</table></div><h3 id="style"> <a href="#style" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="style"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Style</h3><p>While your website will neatly organized and tailored for public consumption, it is important to keep your analysis notebook organized as well.

A very basic site with the required headings and one embedded visualization can be found at <a href="http://rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/">rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/</a>; the source code for the site is <a href="https://github.com/surajrampure/dsc80-proj3-test1">here</a>.</p><h3 id="step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site"> <a href="#step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 1: Initializing a Jekyll GitHub Pages Site</h3><ol><li>Create a GitHub account, if you don’t already have one.<li>Create a new GitHub repository for your project.<ul><li>GitHub Pages sites live at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;reponame&gt;</code> (for instance, the site for <a href="https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-fa">github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-fa</a> is <a href="https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc80-2024-fa">dsc-courses.github.io/dsc80-2024-fa</a>).<li>As such, <strong>don’t</strong> include “DSC 80” or “Final Project” in your repo’s name – this looks unprofessional to future employers, and gives you a generic-sounding URL. Instead, mention that this is a project for DSC 80 at UCSD in the repository description.<li><strong>Make sure to make your repository public.</strong><li>Select “ADD a README file.” This ensures that your repository starts off non-empty, which is necessary to continue.</ul><li>Click “Settings” in the repository toolbar (next to “Insights”), then click “Pages” in the left menu.<li>Under “Branch”, click the “None” dropdown, change the branch to “main”, and then click “Save.” You should soon see “GitHub Pages source saved.” in a blue banner at the top of the page. This initiates GitHub Pages in your repository.<li>After 30 seconds, reload the page again. You should see “<strong>Your site is live at http://username.github.io/reponame/</strong>”. Click that link – you now have a site!<li>Click “Code” in the repo toolbar to return to the source code for your repo.</ol><p>Note that the source code for your site lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>. <strong>As you push changes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, they will update on your site automatically within a few minutes!</strong> Before moving forward, make sure that you can make basic edits:</p><ol><li>Clone your repo locally.<li>Make some edits to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>.<li>Push those changes back to GitHub, using the following steps:<ul><li>Add your changes to “staging” using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add README.md</code> (repeat this for any other files you add).<li>Commit your changes using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m '&lt;some message here&gt;'</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m 'changed title of website'</code>.<li>Push your changes using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>.</ul></ol><p>Moving forward, we recommend making edits to your website source code locally, rather than directly on GitHub.

The <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown cheat sheet</a> contains tips on how to format text and other page components in Markdown (and if you’d benefit by seeing an example, you could always look at the Markdown source of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-sp/gh-pages/project4/index.md">this very page</a> – meta!).</p><p>What will be a bit trickier is embedding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plots in your site so that they are interactive. Note that you are <strong>required</strong> to do this, you cannot simply take screenshots of plots from your notebooks and embed them in your site. Here’s how to embed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot directly in your site.</p><ol><li>First, you’ll need to convert your plot to HTML. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Figure</code> object (for instance, the result of calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">px.express</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go.Figure</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.plot</code> when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pd.options.plotting.backend = "plotly"</code> has been run), then the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html</code> saves the plot as HTML to a file. Call it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html('file-name.html', include_plotlyjs='cdn')</code>.<ul><li>Change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'file-name.html'</code> to the path where you’d like to initially save your plot.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include_plotlyjs='cdn'</code> tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_html</code> to load the source code for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> library from a server, rather than including the entire source code in your HTML file. This drastically reduces the size of the resulting HTML file, keeping your repo size down.</ul><li>Move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> file(s) you’ve created into a folder in your website repo called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets</code> (or something similar).<ul><li>Depending on where your template notebook is saved, you could combine this step with the step above by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html</code> with the correct path (e.g. `fig.write_html(‘../league-match-analysis/assets/matches-per-year.html’)).</ul><li>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, embed your plot using the following syntax:</ol><div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span>
  <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"assets/file-name.html"</span>

  <span class="na">frameborder=</span><span class="s">"0"</span>
<span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iframe</code> stands for “inline frame”; it allows us to embed HTML files within other HTML files.<li>You can change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> arguments, but don’t change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frameBorder</code> argument.</ul><p>Refer <a href="https://github.com/surajrampure/dsc80-proj3-test1">here</a> for a working example.</p><p class="note">Try your best to make your plots look professional and unique to your group – add axis labels, change the font and colors, add annotations, etc. Remember, potential employers will see this – you don’t want your plots to look like everyone else’s! If you’d like to match the styles of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plots used in lecture (e.g. with the white backgrounds), you can import and use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dsc80_utils.py</code> that’s in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proj04</code> folder of our public repo, alongside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template.ipynb</code>.</p><p>To convert a DataFrame in your notebook to Markdown source code (which you need to do for both the <strong>Data Cleaning</strong> and <strong>Interesting Aggregates</strong> sections of Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis in Part 1), use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.to_markdown()</code> method on the DataFrame. For instance,</p><div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counts</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">'Quarter'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'Count'</span><span class="p">]].</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">to_markdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">))</span>

This is because an exact rubric would specify exactly what you need to do to build a model, but figuring out what to do is a large part of Steps 5-8.</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Component<th>Weight<tbody><tr><td><strong>Step 1: Introduction</strong><td>8 points<tr><td><strong>Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> <br />• Cleaned data (8 points)<br />• Performed univariate analyses (8 points)<br />• Performed bivariate analyses and aggregations (8 points)<td>24 points<tr><td><strong>Step 3: Assessment of Missingness</strong> <br />• Addressed NMAR question (4 points) <br /> • Performed permutation tests for missingness (8 points) <br /> • Interpreted missingness test results (8 points)<td>20 points<tr><td><strong>Step 4: Hypothesis Testing</strong><br />• Selected relevant columns for a hypothesis or permutation test (4 points)<br />• Explicitly stated a null hypothesis (4 points)<br />• Explicitly stated an alternative hypothesis (4 points)<br />• Performed a hypothesis or permutation test (8 points)<br />• Used a valid test statistic (4 points)<br />• Computed a \(p\)-value and made a decision (4 points)<td>28 points<tr><td><strong>Step 5: Framing a Prediction Problem</strong><td>15 points<tr><td><strong>Step 6: Baseline Model</strong><td>35 points<tr><td><strong>Step 7: Final Model</strong><td>35 points<tr><td><strong>Step 8: Fairness Analysis</strong><td>15 points<tr><td><strong>Overall: Included all necessary components on the website</strong><td>20 points<tr><td><strong>Total</strong><td><strong>200 points</strong></table></div></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
